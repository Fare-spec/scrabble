# Scrabble – Code Extract

This directory contains only the code required to run the project.  
Full documentation, tests, and the original README are available in the main repository:  
<https://github.com/Fare-spec/scrabble>

## Required Structure

All the files must be placed **in the same directory as `main.py`**

`utils.py` has been modified to meet the assignment requirements.  
Paths to `littres.txt` or `lettre.txt` may have changed; verify and adjust if needed.

All local modules are imported directly in `main.py`.
The gui isn't in this file because it is considered as "bonus". However we'll include it during the presentation and the demo.
The features are exactly those required because after asking we learnt that we couldn't modify the code to our own ideas.
